            <div class="subheading mb-3">User Interface Design Module</div>
            <div>
              <img src="img/smile1.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block fiftysize" width="15%" height="auto">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The SMILE App is a mobile application that I designed for my school's User Interface Design module. With the brief being a product centered around healthcare, my group decided to focus on an dental application due to the lack of dental awareness in Singapore. This is one of the projects that I did that required the most research to be done, and a lot of user interface deisgn fundamentals to be applied.</p>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="img/smile2.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block fiftysize" width="60%" height="auto">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>As per what I usually do, I start off with a paper wireframing. This paper wireframing was done after the main bulk of the research has been done, so things like main functionalities to be included and main colour used has already been taken into account. As seen from the above image, the paper wireframe is just a very rough sketch of what needs to be implemented and what functions will be linked to each other.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="img/smile3.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block fiftysize" width="60%" height="auto">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>After a few iterations of the first paper prototype, I reached the second stage of the project where I cut down the main unnecessary links of the functions, and provided intuitive shortcuts for the users to quickly navigate through the application. As seen above, the functions are now clearly defined and more easily discernable.</p>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="img/smile4.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block fiftysize" width="60%" height="auto">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The wireframing was done on Adobe XD. The preliminary designs you see above were actually an improvement of the basic skeleton of the application. However at this stage, there were still some unnecessary functions as well as aesthetics that could hinder user experience.</p>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="img/smile5.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block fiftysize" width="60%" height="auto">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The final design seen above made use of different shades of blue as the background, which by research shows to have a calming effect on people. The functions are interlinked through simpler and more intuitive designs, making use of everyday functions that you would usually see in a simple lifestyle app or messaging app. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, this project opened my eyes to the reality of how important research is when it comes to user interface design. To ensure that customers or users have the best user experience that they can ask for, one should design the user interface from the customers' point of view rather than from the designer's point of view. This can only be done through extensive research and recursive iterations to better achieve the sweet spot that customers yearn for when using your product.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">CIMB NIAGA Hackathon 2018</div>
            <div>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>For the CIMB NIAGA Hackathon, my 2 friends and I were given the task of producing a Fintech related application that is able to firstly reach out to the mass population, and secondly, suitable for the unbanked people to use, in 24 hours. Since the Hackathon was held in Indonesia, we had to take into account the demographics of Indonesia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After conducting our research, and finding out that the unbanked population in Indonesia is almost 50%, we set out to build our prototype. With less than 20 hours left, our group decided to build an application that goes hand in hand with a prepaid debit card. This prepaid debit card is available to anyone, even the unbanked, and can access all the major electronic payments system in Indonesia. The application which is tied to the prepard debit card will trace and understand the spending and saving behaviours of the individual, and provide useful insights and analysis to help the individual save better so they can pay off basic loans and bills.</p>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="img/niaga2.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block fiftysize" width="60%" height="auto">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>As seen from the above image, the final design allowed users to enter the income status and also opt for whether they wish to save more money. Through Artificial Intelligence, Ro-bert will be able to show users how much they should save a month in order to reach a certain goal. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Even though our team did not win, we were proud to be one of the only 8 teams from Singapore that got into the finals. Through this Hackathon, I was able able to learn how important it is to be able to produce quick iterations of designs in a short period of time, and the importance of communication especially during crunch time. Definitely one of the most valuable experiences I have had over the course of my university life.</p>

            <br>
            <p>This project is a remote Know-Your-Customer application that was developed by my group for my school's Elements of Software Construction module that was in collaboration with IBM. In this project, the group was tasked to build a mobile application that allows for IBM customers to do simple Know-Your-Customers tasks remotely. Functions that has to be included requires basic authentication and verification, as well as backend machine learning implementation which allows for facial recognition.</p>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="img/escibm2.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block fiftysize" width="60%" height="auto">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The application allows for users to check their own account balances and carry out certain transactions. During registration, users will key in certain credentials and also upload their own photos for verification purposes. As seen from the right most page of the image above, the user will have to take a photo of themselves, and a Captcha is implemented to ensure authentication and verification by real human beings instead of bots.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The basic wireframing of this application was done on paper, before moving on to Android Studio where everything from basic layout and user interface of the project, to functionalities and authentication was done on. Python and SQL was also implemented to allow for the use of libraries and to store data. </p>
            <p>This project is one which made me frustrated a lot. Implementation of aestheically pleasing and intuitive user interface design was really tough, as everything was done by code. Nevertheless, being able to finally achieve a fully functional product after so much trial and error was done was really something that I can be proud of.</p>

        <p>Other than my schooling endeavors, I enjoy cooking and making crafts once in a while. I love to swim and I hate running, but it seems I am doing more of the latter nowadays. Recently, I picked up pixel art, and am trying to improve my skills so I am able to draw myself without making myself look censored.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">I play lots of video games as the graphics of skills and movements of characters intrigue one. Once in a while I get stuck admiring or thinking about the user interface designs of the games, and wonder how much thought has been put into such work. I also a lot of time exploring the different advancements in the front-end web development scene.</p>
